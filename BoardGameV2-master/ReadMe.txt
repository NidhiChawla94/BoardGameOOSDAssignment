2. How to Play our game?
Ans: The steps to play the game are:
		1. Initially run a new game.
		2. The team at the bottom is "Avengers" and the one at the top of board is: "XMen". The team whose current turn is to play is written at the top of the board.
		3. Select a combat ability : Attack/Defence Mode. So click on Attack or Defence button before each move.
		4. Drag and drop the piece (from the team who has current turn) to move.
		5. If you have selected the "Attack" mode then from the drop down select the power from which you want to attack. Each piece has different powers and their magnitude differ.
		6. If you want to take a healer (shown as banana, apple) then you have to place your piece on them.
		7. If you want to undo: then click on Undo button.
